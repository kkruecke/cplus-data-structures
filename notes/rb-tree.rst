A red-black tree is a binary tree representation of a 2-3-4 tree. 

A 2-, 3- and 4-nodes is transformed into its red-black representation as follows:

Red Black Trees (under develpment)
==================================

**Contents Under Development...**

The insert and delete algorithms for  a `2-3-4-trees` ensure a balanced tree, but a 2-3-4 tree wastes storage. A red black tree represents a 2 3 4 tree as a \ |apos|\ balanced binary search tree.
