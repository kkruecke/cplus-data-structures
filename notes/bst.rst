Binary Search Trees
===================

Discussion of BST
-----------------

There are several deletion algorithms for BST

Hibbard Delete Algorithm

* `Excellent slides illustration Hibbard Deletion algorithm for BST <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/32BinarySearchTrees.pdf>`_
* `Emory: Hibbard delete algorithm for BST <http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/171/Syllabus/9-BinTree/BST-delete2.html>`_  Has illustrations and thorough code.

The CLRS Algorithm

* `CLRS Chapter 13: Binary Search Trees <http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap13.htm>`_ 
* `Binary Search Trees <https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/360/trees.bst.html>`_ . Uses CLRS Algorithm and its transplant helper.
* `Notes on Binary Search Trees  <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~siff/CS367/Notes/bsts.html>`_

Replace with Successor

* Corano's Walls and Mirrors textbook
* Adam Drozdek's textbook
