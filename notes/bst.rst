Binary Search Trees
===================

Discussion of BST
-----------------

There is more than one deletion algorithms for BST

Textbooks

* Corrano's Walls and Mirrors textbook pp 477-483
* Adam Drozdek's textbook pp 245-250.

Hibbard Delete Algorithm and Successor-based 

* `Algorithms 4th Edition by Sedgewich & Wayne <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/32bst/>`_ performance problems of Hibbard deletion using successor approach.
* `Sedgwich Powerpoint Slides <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/32BinarySearchTrees.pdf>`_ and why Hibbard deletion is an unsatisfactory solution 
* `Emory Univ.: Hibbard delete algorithm for BST <http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/171/Syllabus/9-BinTree/BST-delete2.html>`_ with illustrations and complete source code.
* `Notes on Binary Search Trees <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~siff/CS367/Notes/bsts.html>`_ 
* `Introduction to Algorithms, 1990 version <http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap13.htm>`_ .

Binary Search Tree contemporary transplatn-based delete algorithm

* `Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition <http://ressources.unisciel.fr/algoprog/s00aaroot/aa00module1/res/%5BCormen-AL2011%5DIntroduction_To_Algorithms-A3.pdf>`_
* `Radford.edu <https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/360/trees.bst.html>`_ . Uses CLRS Algorithm and its transplant helper.
