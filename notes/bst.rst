Binary Search Trees
===================

Discussion of BST
-----------------

There is more than one deletion algorithms for BST

Textbooks

* Corrano's Walls and Mirrors textbook pp 477-483
* Adam Drozdek's textbook pp 245-250.

Successor-based

* `Notes on Binary Search Trees <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~siff/CS367/Notes/bsts.html>`_ used the get-successor approach. Has succint pseudo code, but the article is brief.
* `CLRS Chapter 13: Binary Search Trees (1990 Version of book) <http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap13.htm>`_ 

Hibbard Delete Algorithm

* `Sedgwich slides illustrating the Hibbard Deletion algorithm for BST <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/32BinarySearchTrees.pdf>`_
* `Emory Univ.: Hibbard delete algorithm for BST <http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/171/Syllabus/9-BinTree/BST-delete2.html>`_  Has illustrations and thorough code.

The CLRS "Algorithm" (the 3rd Edition seems to have changed to a different implementation)

* `Chapter 12 of Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition <http://ressources.unisciel.fr/algoprog/s00aaroot/aa00module1/res/%5BCormen-AL2011%5DIntroduction_To_Algorithms-A3.pdf>`_
* `Binary Search Trees <https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/360/trees.bst.html>`_ . Uses CLRS Algorithm and its transplant helper.
