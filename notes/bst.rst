Binary Search Trees
===================

Discussion of BST
-----------------

There is more than one deletion algorithms for BST

Textbooks

* Corrano's Walls and Mirrors textbook pp 477-483
* Adam Drozdek's textbook pp 245-250.

Hibbard Delete Algorithm and Successor-based 

* `Algorithms 4th Edition by Sedgewich & Wayne: Performance Problems with Hibbard deletion algorithm and successor approach <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/32bst/>`_
* `Sedgwich slides illustrating Hibbard deletion algorithm and why it is an unsatisfactory solution <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/32BinarySearchTrees.pdf>`_
* `Emory Univ.: Hibbard delete algorithm for BST <http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/171/Syllabus/9-BinTree/BST-delete2.html>`_  Has illustrations and thorough code.
* `Notes on Binary Search Trees pdf by Sedgewick & Wayne <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~siff/CS367/Notes/bsts.html>`_ used the get-successor approach. Has succint pseudo code, but the article is brief.
* `Introduction to Algorithms, 1990 version, with successor-based algorithm: Chapter 13: Binary Search Trees (1990 Version of book) <http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap13.htm>`_ 

Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, transplant-based Algorithm

* `Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, with transplate-based algorithm <http://ressources.unisciel.fr/algoprog/s00aaroot/aa00module1/res/%5BCormen-AL2011%5DIntroduction_To_Algorithms-A3.pdf>`_
* `Radford.edu: Binary Search Trees with transplant-based delete algorithm <https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/360/trees.bst.html>`_ . Uses CLRS Algorithm and its transplant helper.
