Binary Search Trees
===================

Discussion of BST
-----------------

There is more than one deletion algorithms for BST

Textbooks

* Corrano's Walls and Mirrors textbook pp 477-483
* Adam Drozdek's textbook pp 245-250.

Successor-based

* `Notes on Binary Search Trees <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~siff/CS367/Notes/bsts.html>`_ used the get-successor approach. Has succint pseudo code, but the article is brief.

Hibbard Delete Algorithm

* `Sedgwich slides illustrating the Hibbard Deletion algorithm for BST <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/32BinarySearchTrees.pdf>`_
* `Emory Univ.: Hibbard delete algorithm for BST <http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/171/Syllabus/9-BinTree/BST-delete2.html>`_  Has illustrations and thorough code.

The CLRS "Algorithm" (it seems to be a separate approach, with transplant)

* `CLRS Chapter 13: Binary Search Trees <http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap13.htm>`_ 
* `Binary Search Trees <https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/360/trees.bst.html>`_ . Uses CLRS Algorithm and its transplant helper.
