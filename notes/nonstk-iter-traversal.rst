Iterative Traversal Algorithms Part II
======================================

Non Stack-Based Iterative Algorithmns
--------------------------------------

If the node class has a parent pointer, tree traversal can be done iteratively without recourse to stack. Below non-stack-based iterators classes for in-order, pre-order and post-order recursion algorithms are discussed.
